# Computer-Vision
Develop a program in C++ to locate and recognise 81 information signs from Dublin train stations in the 33 provided images (in the Blue Signs/Testing. folder provided with TIPS).  The provided code will load all images for you, gives you a framework to develop your code to locate and recognise each sign, and provides you with code that will automatically evaluate the performance of your system.  It will show each image with all recognised signs and all mistaken signs
- located and recognized blue signboards on the Dublin Train Station
- Developed a program in C++ using OpenCV
- Used OpenCV and Computer Vision techniques such as Canny edge detection and find contours to locate potential blue sign boards
- Used template matching to recognize the potential blue sign board
-Tested the program on variety of image provided(100 approx.) and achieved a F1 score of 80%
